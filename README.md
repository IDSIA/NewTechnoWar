**New Techno War** is tabletop [wargame](https://deftech.ch/it/wargaming/) developed by [Helvetia Games](https://helvetia-games.ch/) in collaboration with [Armasuisse](https://www.ar.admin.ch/en/armasuisse-wissenschaft-und-technologie-w-t/home.html). **New Techno War** makes it easy to simulate future systems integrating new technologies while stimulating discussions. The goal here is not to win, but to understand the strengths and weaknesses induced by these future systems in given tactical scenarios.

In this collaboration between IDSIA and Armasuisse, we aim to build a *companion agent* based on XAI that can help the players make strategical decisions and solving various combat scenario with different goals and constraints.
